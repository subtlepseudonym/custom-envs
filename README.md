## Custom files for various environments

I'll try to keep these files up to date, but mostly likely I'll place them here when they're first created and only update them seldomly.

Just a quick note on the off chance someone else is browsing through here -- the Xresources (at least for urxvt) sets some colors that completely disregard their name (magenta comes out yellow). :)
